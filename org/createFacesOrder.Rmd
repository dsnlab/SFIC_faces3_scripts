This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("/Volumes/psych-cog/dsnlab/SFIC/SFIC_faces3_scripts/org")
order <- read.csv("SFIC_to_sfiz_IDs.csv", header=T)
order <- setNames(order, c("sfizID","sub","order"))
order$sub <- sprintf("%03d", order$sub)
order$sub <- sub("^", "sub-L", order$sub)

IDs <- read.csv("subject_list.txt", header=F)
IDs <- setNames(IDs, "sub")

order <- merge(IDs, order, by = "sub", all.x=T)

write.csv(order, file="FacesOrder.csv",row.names=F)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
